### Chess Knight Problem Logic Explanation

The problem is about determining if a knight, starting from one position on a chessboard, can reach another position following the knight's specific movement constraints in chess. Here's the logical breakdown:

1. **Input**: Four integers representing the start and end coordinates on an 8x8 chessboard. The format is `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, where `(x1, y1)` is the starting position and `(x2, y2)` is the target position.

2. **Chessboard Initialization**: An 8x8 board is created with all positions marked as `False` (not reachable).

3. **Marking Reachable Squares**: Using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to mark squares reachable from `(x1-1, y1-1)`:
   - The knight moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction, then one square perpendicular. Only forward or same-row moves are considered: `(-2, 1)`, `(-1, 2)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 1)`.
   - BFS explores all possible moves level by level, marking squares as reachable (`True`).

4. **Checking the Target Position**: After marking reachable squares, check if `(x2-1, y2-1)` is `True`. If so, output "yes" (reachable); otherwise, "no" (not reachable).

### Python Implementation

```python
def main():
    start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y = map(int, input().split())
    result = can_knight_reach(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y)
    print("yes" if result else "no")

def can_knight_reach(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y):
    chessboard = initialize_chessboard(start_x - 1, start_y - 1)
    return chessboard[end_x - 1][end_y - 1]

def initialize_chessboard(start_x, start_y):
    board = [[False for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]
    mark_reachable_squares(board, start_x, start_y)
    return board

def mark_reachable_squares(board, x, y):
    knight_moves = [(-2, 1), (-1, 2), (1, 2), (2, 1)]
    queue = [(x, y)]
    while queue:
        current_x, current_y = queue.pop(0)
        for move in knight_moves:
            next_x, next_y = current_x + move[0], current_y + move[1]
            if 0 <= next_x < 8 and 0 <= next_y < 8 and not board[next_x][next_y]:
                board[next_x][next_y] = True
                queue.append((next_x, next_y))

main()
```

### Representation

Below is a visual representation of how the knight moves on the chessboard. The knight can move in an "L" shape, but only in the forward direction or staying on the same row:

```
Start Position: (x1, y1) = (1, 1)
Target Position: (x2, y2) = (8, 8)

Board Representation:
8 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  T
7 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
6 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
5 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
4 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
3 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
2 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
1 | S  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  -------------------------
    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8

S = Start Position
T = Target Position

Knight Moves (Forward Only):
From (1, 1):
1. (1 + 2, 1 + 1) -> (3, 2)
2. (1 + 1, 1 + 2) -> (2, 3)
From (3, 2):
1. (3 + 2, 2 + 1) -> (5, 3)
2. (3 + 1, 2 + 2) -> (4, 4)
...

Continuing this way, the knight will eventually reach the target position (8, 8) if it's possible given the constraints.
```

This representation provides a step-by-step visualization of how the knight moves from the start position to the target position by following the allowed forward "L" shaped moves.
